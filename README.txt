Intro to Level Design Homework
description: my intention for this game was to build buildings where the character can explore and find hidden objects to find. by exploring all of the buildings and finiding the glowing boxes which are meant to contain objects inside them that the character needs to escape the level and go to the next one. once all of it are collected the charecter can combine the objects and use them to escape.
